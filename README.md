ExamFlow: Automated Exam Hall Seating Arrangement
ExamFlow is a robust web application built with Java and Spring Boot to automate the process of randomizing and assigning seating arrangements for students in an examination hall. It provides dedicated views for students, invigilators, and a powerful admin panel for seamless management.

✨ Features
👨‍🎓 Student View: Allows students to securely check their assigned exam hall and seat number close to the exam time.

🧑‍🏫 Invigilator View: Provides a detailed, printable seating layout for a specific hall, showing which student is assigned to each bench.

👑 Admin Panel: A comprehensive dashboard for administrators to manage student data, hall details, and exam schedules. Admins can add, update, and delete records as needed.

🤖 Automated Randomization: A time-based scheduler that automatically triggers the seat allocation logic 2 hours before a confirmed exam.

⚙️ Intelligent Rules Engine:

Randomization only occurs if an admin confirms the exam slot.

Admin confirmation is locked 3.5 hours before the exam.

Seating data is automatically cleared 4 hours after an exam concludes.

🧱 Block Allocation: Implements a block-based randomization strategy, grouping students from the same branch into contiguous blocks within an exam hall.
